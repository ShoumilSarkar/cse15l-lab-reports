# Lab Report 3 More on SSH

## Streamlining SSH Configuration

I added these 4 lines into the ```.ssh/config``` config file 
![SSH Config](./Lab%205%20SSH%20Config%20File.png)

The alias given to this was ```ieng6```
![SSH Config](./ieng6%20login.png)

Copying over the file can now be done like this
![Simplified SCP](./Lab%205%20Simplified%20SCP.png)

## Setup Github Access From ieng6

## Copy Whole Directory Recursively(```scp -r```)
